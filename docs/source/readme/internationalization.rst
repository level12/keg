Internationalization
====================

Keg can optionally be installed with the ``morphi`` library to use ``babel`` for internationalization::

    pip install keg[i18n]

The ``setup.cfg`` file is configured to handle the standard message extraction commands. For ease of development
and ensuring that all marked strings have translations, a tox environment is defined for testing i18n. This will
run commands to update and compile the catalogs, and specify any strings which need to be added.

The desired workflow here is to run tox, update strings in the PO files as necessary, run tox again
(until it passes), and then commit the changes to the catalog files.

.. code::

    tox -e i18n
