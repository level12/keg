Keg's Goal
==========

The goal for this project is to encapsulate Flask best practices and libraries so devs can avoid
boilerplate and work on the important stuff.

We will lean towards being opinionated on the big things (like SQLAlchemy as our ORM) while
supporting hooks and customizations as much as possible.

Think North of Flask but South of Django.
